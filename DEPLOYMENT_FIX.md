# Coolify Deployment 404 Fix

## Issue Identified
The 404 errors indicate the container is running but the Node.js application isn't serving files correctly. This is likely due to missing static files or startup issues in production mode.

## Root Causes
1. Static files (frontend build) may not be properly served
2. Application might not be starting correctly in production
3. Missing package.json in production container

## Fix Applied
Updated Dockerfile to ensure:
- package.json is copied to production stage
- Static files are properly included
- Application has all necessary files to start

## Quick Test Commands
Check if the container is running properly:

```bash
# In Coolify container logs, look for:
# "serving on port 5000" - indicates app started
# Any error messages during startup
```

## Manual Container Debug (if needed)
If the issue persists, you can debug by:

1. **Check Coolify Logs**: Look for application startup errors
2. **Restart Container**: Force restart in Coolify dashboard
3. **Verify Environment**: Ensure all environment variables are set

## Expected Fix
After the updated Dockerfile is deployed:
- Health check should respond at `/api/health`
- Main application should load at root URL
- Both superadmin and business logins should work

The application should serve the React frontend and handle API routes properly.
