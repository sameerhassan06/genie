# Final Fix for 404 Issue - Simplified Dockerfile

## Problem Analysis
The 404 errors persist because of complex static file serving configuration. The symlinks and user permissions were creating conflicts.

## Solution: Simplified Dockerfile
Created a clean, simple Dockerfile that:
1. Builds the application in builder stage
2. Copies static files directly to `/app/public` (where server expects them)
3. Removes symlinks and user switching complexity
4. Runs as root for simplicity (common in containerized apps)

## Key Changes
- Direct copy: `COPY --from=builder /app/dist/public ./public`
- Removed user switching that was causing permission issues
- Simplified paths to match server expectations exactly
- Removed debugging code for production readiness

## Next Steps
Push this simplified Dockerfile:

```bash
git add Dockerfile
git commit -m "Simplify Dockerfile to fix static file serving"
git push origin main
```

Then redeploy in Coolify. This should resolve the 404 issues and make your platform fully accessible.
