# Quick Redeploy Fix for 404 Issue

## Issue Fixed
The 404 errors were caused by the static files not being in the correct location for production serving.

**Problem**: Server looked for static files in `/app/public` but they were built to `/app/dist/public`
**Solution**: Added symlink in Dockerfile to make static files accessible at expected path

## Updated Dockerfile
- Fixed static file path with symlink: `ln -sf dist/public public`
- This makes the built frontend assets available where the server expects them

## Quick Redeploy Steps
1. Push the updated Dockerfile to GitHub:
```bash
git add Dockerfile
git commit -m "Fix static file serving for production deployment"
git push origin main
```

2. Redeploy in Coolify:
   - Go to your application in Coolify
   - Click "Deploy" or "Force Rebuild"
   - Wait for build to complete

## Expected Result
After redeploy:
- ✅ Health check responds: `/api/health`
- ✅ Main app loads: homepage
- ✅ API routes work: `/api/*`
- ✅ Login functionality works

Your platform should be fully accessible with superadmin and business user logins working correctly.
