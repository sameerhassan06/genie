# Coolify Build Fix - Updated Dockerfile

## Issue Resolved
The Coolify deployment was failing because the build stage was only installing production dependencies (`npm ci --only=production`), but Vite and other build tools are dev dependencies needed for the build process.

## Fixed Dockerfile
I've updated the Dockerfile to:

1. **Builder Stage**: Install ALL dependencies (including dev dependencies) for building
2. **Production Stage**: Install only production dependencies and copy built files
3. **Optimized**: Separate production dependencies from build artifacts

## Deploy Again in Coolify

Your repository now has the fixed Dockerfile. In Coolify:

1. **Redeploy** your application (it will pull the latest code)
2. Or **Force Rebuild** if it doesn't automatically detect the changes

The build should now succeed and your platform will be live!

## What the Fixed Build Does

### Builder Stage:
- Installs all dependencies (including Vite, TypeScript, etc.)
- Builds frontend and backend
- Creates optimized production bundle

### Production Stage:
- Only installs runtime dependencies
- Copies built files
- Runs as non-root user for security
- Starts with `node dist/index.js`

## Expected Result
After successful deployment:
- Health check at `/api/health` responds
- Platform accessible with demo data
- Superadmin login: `admin` / `admin123`
- Business login: `johndoe` / `password123`

The build should complete in 3-5 minutes with all dependencies properly installed.
