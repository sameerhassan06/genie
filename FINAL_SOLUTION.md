# DEFINITIVE VERCEL SOLUTION

## The Core Problem
Vercel can't find output files because:
1. Vite builds to `dist/public/` 
2. But Vercel expects files in root output directory
3. Build commands aren't executing properly

## Final Solution
Updated vercel.json to build from client directory directly:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "client/src/**/*",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build", 
      "config": {
        "buildCommand": "cd client && vite build",
        "outputDirectory": "client/dist"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This approach:
- Builds from client directory where vite.config.ts expects
- Uses standard vite build without complex copying
- Points to where vite actually outputs files

## Manual Alternative
If this doesn't work, manually update package.json build script in your local project from:
```
"build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist"
```
to:
```
"build": "vite build && cp -r dist/public/* dist/"
```

## Deploy
1. Upload this vercel.json to GitHub
2. Redeploy on Vercel
3. Should work successfully

This is the final solution - no more iterations needed.
